create a git repository and its repective brances
develop the terraform code
develop the jenkins pipeline code
-    there is a need for a jenkinsfile per brances
setup jenkins pipline job
-   need jenkins job per branch
poll each branch & trigger respective pipeline job (commit/merge)

develop single jenkinsfile, with conditional stages
use jenkins multi-branch pipeline to automate pipeline job creation.


the approval will only be on DEV and PRO pipeline
